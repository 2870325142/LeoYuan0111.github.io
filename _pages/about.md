# Zeqing Yuan (Leo)

Hi, I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science in [Turing Class](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), jointly cultivated by [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/wbout/list.psp) and [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/).

My current research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning.

Besides research, I am also a sports fan and badminton champion.
