# Zeqing Yuan (Leo)

# About me
I am an undergraduate student at [Turing Class](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm) (Experimental Class for Top-Notched Talents in Computer Science), [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/wbout/list.psp), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My current research interest includes machine learning and visual computing.

I am also a badminton provincial champion certified as National First-Class Athlete. For the passion in sports, I have explored the intersectional area of sports analytics by means of computer vision and immersive visualization.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
