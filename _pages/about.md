# Zeqing Yuan (Leo) | Ë¢ÅÊ≥ΩÊ∏Ö

# About me
I am an undergraduate student at [Turing Class](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm) (Experimental Class for Top-Notched Talents in Computer Science), [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/wbout/list.psp), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

My current research interests lie in machine learning and visual computing.

I am also a badminton provincial champion certified as National First-Class Athlete. For the passion in sports, I have explored the intersectional area of sports analytics by means of computer vision and immersive visualization.
