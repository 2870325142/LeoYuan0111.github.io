ABSTRACT = {With the development of underwater technology and the increasing demand for ocean development, more and more intelligent equipment is being applied to underwater scientific missions. Specifically, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) clusters are being used for their flexibility and the advantages of carrying communication and detection units, often performing underwater tasks in formation. In order to locate AUVs with high precision, we introduce an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with global positioning system (GPS) and propose a USV–AUV network. Furthermore, we propose an ultra-short baseline (USBL) acoustic cooperative location scheme with an orthogonal array, which is based on underwater communication with sonar. Based on the derivation of the Fisher information matrix formula under Cartesian parameters, we analyze the positioning accuracy of AUVs in different positions under the USBL positioning mode to derive the optimal array of the AUV formation. In addition, we propose a USV path planning scheme based on Dubins path planning functions to assist in locating the AUV formation. The simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can ensure the positioning accuracy of the AUV formation and help underwater research missions.},
